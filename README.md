## 🔧 Customization

Want to modify the game? Here's how:

### Change Colors
Find this section in the HTML `<style>` block:
```css
:root {
  --neon-pink: #FF006E;    /* Change me! */
  --neon-blue: #00F5FF;    /* Change me! */
  --neon-purple: #8338EC;  /* Change me! */
}
```

### Adjust Difficulty
Find this in the JavaScript section:
```javascript
this.speed = 0.05;        // Starting speed
this.maxSpeed = 0.3;      // Maximum speed
```

### Modify Game Rules
Look for these variables:
```javascript
this.currentLane = 1;     // Starting lane (0, 1, or 2)
if (Math.random() < 0.02) // Obstacle spawn rate
```
